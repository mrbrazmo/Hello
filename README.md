# Hello

My name is Mauricio Aguilar Villalobos, I am an electrical engineer from Costa Rica and I am
looking for new opportunities to apply all my knowledge in the field of electrical engineering and
broaden my skills.

Some of the characteristics that define me as a professional are efficient, conscientious, and analytical.
I adapt to new roles and responsibilities quickly and face new challenges eagerly. I am independent,
but thrive in a group-setting and enjoy all social encounters. I am flexible and able to work with
colleagues from different backgrounds, as I have work experience both in Costa Rica and in the
United States. I am looking forward to more opportunities to travel abroad and learn from different
cultures, which makes me a perfect fit for this role. 

I am looking forward to working at a worldwide company with an amazing and dedicated team. I am
hoping to be an excellent match to your team and looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

Mauricio Aguilar Villalobos,
Electrical Engineer.
